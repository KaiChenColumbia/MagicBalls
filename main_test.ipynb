    "        - The opponent's action is defined at a random rate\n",
    "        - Due to limited speed, it cannot catch certain servings e.g. when the ball heads from upper half towards upper corner while it is in the lower half of the field\n",
    "- **RL process:**\n",
    "    + Observation VS exploring - We settled on 100k observations steps and 1000k exploring steps. To balance the exploration/exploitation tradeoff, we raised the observation steps after finding our agent trapped in a local optimal policy to only move downwards\n",
    "    + Learning reward - We designed the reward system to enhance several actions:\n",
    "        - For the first catch in a round, whichever player catches the ball is rewarded 3 points. We encourage our agent to catch more serve with this design\n",
    "        - For continuing catch in the round, reward is given at $3*0.6^{catch times}$. We discourage our agent to be trapped in tacit agreement to stay put and make every catch\n",
    "- **CNN network:**\n",
    "    + The structure is based on DeepMind\n",
    "    + We improved it with ReLu, adding one maxpooling layer for stability, and adding one dropout layer against overfitting"
